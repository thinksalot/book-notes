# Awaken The Giant Within - Tony Robbins

### Dreams of Destiny
- All of past problems and frustations create foundation for the understanding need create a new beginning
- We have this immeasurable capacity to focus all our resources on the mastery of one single task. When we focus consitently on achieving one task, we begin to develop unique understanding on how to excel in it.
- The resources we need to turn our dreams into reality are within us, merely waiting for us to activate them.
- Our desire to imporve and be better serves as an invisible hand that guides us.
- Stats show that less than 10% people that buy a book read it beyond the first chapter.
- May people fear change as they believe its only temporary and will result in disappointment. But what they lack is the organization and planning to make change work.
- Raise your standards: Realise what you demand from yourself and tolerate no less. Understand what you are, what you want to be (and stop being what you dont want to be)
- Change your limiting belief: Develope a sense of conviction that you can and will reach the standards you set yourself for before you actually do
- Change your strategy: Pick the best strategy for achieving results (best is to find a role model)
- Lots of people know that they should do, but very few do what they know.
- Practice emotional mastery as virtually anything we do is to change the way we feel
- Be in control of your physical life to feel energetic, powerful, ready to take on a new day. Most of us are **"digging our graves with our teeth"**
- Master relationship - discovery what you truly value in life, you expectations, your life rules.
- Financial mastery - do not simply pursue wealth, stop seeing it as the end-all and be-all for happiness
- Master time - Manage your desires for instantaneous gratification. Short-term evaluations can lead to long term pain. Allow time for your ideas, creations, potential to reach full fruition. Develop patience to experience "lag time". **Most people overestimate what they can accomplish in a year and underestimate what they can achieve in a decade**
- Repitition is the mother of skill
- By changing one word in our vocab, we can alter our emotional state
- By changing the questions we can consciously or unconsciously ask ourselves, we could change our focus and actions we take in daily life
