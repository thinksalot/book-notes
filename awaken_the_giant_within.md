# Awaken The Giant Within - Tony Robbins

### Dreams of Destiny
- All of our past problems and frustations create foundation for the understanding we need to create a new beginning
- We have this immeasurable capacity to focus all our resources on the mastery of one single task. When we focus consistently on achieving one task, we begin to develop unique understanding on how to excel in it.
- The resources we need to turn our dreams into reality are within us, merely waiting for us to activate them.
- **Stats show that less than 10% people that buy a book read it beyond the first chapter.**
- Many people fear change as they believe its only temporary and will result in disappointment. But what they lack is the organization and planning to make change work.
- Raise your standards: Realise what you demand from yourself and tolerate no less. Understand what you are, what you want to be (and stop being what you dont want to be)
- Change your limiting belief: Develop conviction that you can and will reach the standards you set for yourself before you actually do
- Change your strategy: Pick the best strategy for achieving results (best is to find a role model)
- Lots of people know that they should do, but very few do what they know.
- Practice emotional mastery as virtually anything we do is to change the way we feel
- Be in control of your physical life to feel energetic, powerful, ready to take on a new day. Most of us are **"digging our graves with our teeth"**
- Master relationship - discovery what you truly value in life, you expectations, your life rules.
- Financial mastery - do not simply pursue wealth, stop seeing it as the end-all and be-all for happiness
- Master time - Manage your desires for instantaneous gratification. Short-term evaluations can lead to long term pain. Allow time for your ideas, creations, potential to reach full fruition. Develop patience to experience "lag time". **Most people overestimate what they can accomplish in a year and underestimate what they can achieve in a decade**
- Repitition is the mother of skill
- By changing one word in our vocab, we can alter our emotional state
- By changing the questions we can consciously or unconsciously ask ourselves, we could change our focus and actions we take in daily life

### Decisions: The Pathway to Power
- Decision has come to be loosely defined as a wish list or a preference. Making a true decision is totally committing yourself to achieving a result and then cutting yourself of all other possibility. An alcoholic cannot attain sobriety if he fools himself into thinking that one last drink wont really matter.
- **Develop consistent actions** in order to shape our lives. Its what we do consistently that matters, not what we do once in a while
- Our decision to take action determines our destiny, not our environment and circumstances.
- We should **stop making excuses our Belief Systems**.
- Merely being interested to become a better person and achieve higher goals isnt enough. Be **committed** to live life at a higher level.
- Gandhi's indomitable decision to get rid of the British set into motion a chain of events that forever changed the balance of world power. He simply decided there was no other way. His decision sparked the process to making an impossible a possibility.
- Rosa Parks's decision to hold herself to a higher standard marked the beginning of the civil rights movement
- The story of Ed Roberts, a quadraplegic, is a powerful evidence that its not where you start out but the decision you make about where you're determined to end up that matter.
- When you truly decide that you'll do something, you will find a way. The "how" will eventually reveal itself
- The secret to making decisions is to simply make more of them. Strengthen the flabby decision making muscles.
- Information is power when acted upon. Decision stem from actionable information. We understand something better when we begin to use it. Profound knowledge is something that can be immediately put into action.
- Determine **what to focus on**, **what things mean to you** and **what to do**
  - Ed Roberts chose to focus on how he could make a difference (rather than his problems or disability). His physical difficulties meant a "challenge" to him and he decided to make quality of lives of all people like him better
- Study people enjoying greater success in your area. Learn what they are doing different.
- Stop suffering from "The Niagara Syndrome" when making decision. Stop jumping into rive before deciding where you want to end up. You'll only end up in being caught in the current: current events, current fears, current challenges. Before you realize it, you are 10 feet from the Niagara Falls and its too late to do anything. Decide to plan ahead. Long-term focus with persistence is a must for success.
- Develop your own system for making decisions. Most people dont make a conscious decisions. They are affected by the influence of peers, parents, teachers, tv, ads etc. Dont allow programming of the past to control the present and the future.
- **Success is the result of good judgement. Good judgement is the result of experience, and experience is often the result of bad judgement.** Whe people success, they party; when they fail they tend to ponder and make new distinctions, to learn form it.
- Almost all successful people have made more poor mistakes that any of us.
- Mastery takes as long as you want it to take. The answer the question "How long would it take for me to master a particular skill ?" is often "How long do you want it to take ?". If you practice 10 times a day, you'll learn quicker than compared to just 2 times a day.
- Its invaluable to have a good role model. They can provide you with maps to navigate the rapids before so that you dont end up over the falls. Try to find role models in career, finances, relationships, health; a model for all aspects of your life.
- **There are no failures in life**. The only failure is not learning from your mistakes.
- Make a decision, take massive action, if its not working keep changing your approach until you get it right.
- Story of Soichioro Honda, founder of Honda Corp.
- Story of Billy Joel on how he converted impossible in the short term into a phenomenal example to success and happiness in the long term.
- Some people see winter as a cold, depressing and hibernating period. Others go bobsledding and skiing! While you are waiting for the future, make the most out of the present.
- Think in terms of seasons. Present in terms of planting and harvesting. Future in terms of reaping rewards of the harvest.
- **Action flows from true decision.** If you havent acted yet, you havent made a decision.
- Studies show that most successful people make decisions rapidly because they are clear in their values and what they really want for their lives( long term focus). They are also slow to change their decisions, if at all (delay instantaneous gratifications). On the other hand, people who fail usually make decisions slowly and change their minds quickly, always bouncing back and forth. Just decide!
- Stay committed to your decisions but stay flexible to your approaches. Look out for alternatives!

### The force that shapes your life
- Everything we do, we do either out of our need to avoid pain or our desire to gain pleasure. Our behaviour is not driven by reason or intellectual calculations, but our instinctive reaction to pain and pleasure.
- "A man who suffers before it is necessary, suffers more than is necessary" - Seneca
- Most people experience pain but are unwilling to change because they havent reached their **emotional threshold** ie the level of pain they arent willing to settle for
- We frequently create false associations in our nervous system (neuro-associations) as to what will create pain or pleasure. If we can reprogram this, we can harness the enormous power of pain and pleasure. But if we fail to program ourselves, we are not better than animals or machines, shaped by external influences like the media and ads, like a public computer programmed by amateur programmers.
  - Pepsi used Michael Jackson to get us in peak emotional state and flashed their product. Continuous repetitions of this created an emotional linkage for millions of Jaskson's fans. He was like an "state inducer"
  - California Raisin Advisory Board used adverts to revive their declining sales by linking raisins to excitement and fun rather than boredom
- "If you are distressed by anything external, the pain is not due to the thing itself but to your own estimate of it; and this you have the power to revoke at any moment" - Marcus Aurelius
  - Its how we interpret these events that determines how we think about ourselves and how we will act in the future
- Most of us make our decisions involving pain or pleasure in the short-term instead of the long term. Anything valuable that we want requires us to break through some short-term pain in order to gain long-term pleasure.
- Most people think that changing will lead to unknown which will be more painful than they are already experiencing, like the proverbs "Better the devil you know that the devil you dont know" and "A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush". But most of the time, the fear that we are allowing to control us never come to reality anyway.

### Belief systems: The power to create and the power to destroy
- Its not the environment, but how interpret events that shapes us who we are today and who we'll become tomorrow.
  - Two sons born 11 months apart from an alcoholic apart who murders a liquor store cashier have entirely different personalities. One becomes a drug addict but other an upright citizen that raises 3 kids with a successful marriage and good carrier.
  - Two pilots are shot down and taken prisoner in Vietnam. One commits suicide due to torture but other pulls through the beatings with a deeper belief in himself.
  - Instead of thinking that they have a different strategy to learning, some people think they are "learning disabled"
  - Viktor Frankl endured the Holocaust and was able to endure and transform the "hell on earth" experience by finding an empowering meaning for pain
- Beliefs are our generalization for what leads to pain and what leads to pleasure. They sometimes become our limiting beliefs.
- Beliefs not only impact emotions or actions, but they can also lead to some minor physical transformations.
  - Research by Dr. Bernie Siegel on Multiple personality disorder patients shows that eye color changes and physical marks disappear and reappear, even diseases like diabetes and high blood pressure come and go depending upon the persons personality and belief
  - When news of food poisoning broke out, even people who hadnt been poisoned became ill or fainted. When they found out they werent poisoned, they again miraculously recovered.
- Belief cultivates an idea of certainty which allows us to do things we might have otherwise not been able to accomplish.
- Belief gives legs for our ideas to stand upon. The stronger the legs, deeper is our sense of certainty. Weaker legs make the tables wobbly.
- The more references we have about our idea, the more intensely we have a belief on them. Reference can come from things we've experiences, information we get or even from our imagination.
- We can even use our imagined references to propel us to succeed in the direction we want. Our brain cannot tell the difference between something vividly imagined and something we've actually experienced. **With enough emotional intensity and repetition, our nervous systems experience something as real, even if it hasnt occured yet.**
  - Bill Gates used his belief to delivery software to IBM in a few weeks
  - When Roger Bannister in 1954 ran the four-minute mile, more people could do it because he gave them the belief
  - Because people havent succeeded in the past, they think they will not succeed in the future. So they focus on being "realistic" which really means living in fear of pain and disappointment again
  - Great leaders are rarely "realistic". Gandhi taking on the British, Walt Disney building the park (first of its kind at the time)
- **If we are going to make errors in life, err on the side of overestimating your capabilities**
  - Optimists are more hopeful of their chances whereas pessimists are more "realistic"
- **Learned helplessness** - because of past mistakes and failures, people start believing that things are pointless, they're helpless or worthless and no matter what they do, they'll lose anyways
  - 3 patterns of belief that creates learned helplessness (by Dr.Martin Seligman)
    - Permanence - People see even their smallest problems as permament. Achiveres on the otherhad think that if they keep on persisting, they will find a way. "This, too, shall pass"
    - Pervasiveness - Pessimists believe that because they screwed up in one area, they are a screw up! An achiever never sees a problem as one that controls his/her life.
    - Personal - People see failure as a personality defect which leads to an overwhelming feeling because we cannot change our life or personality overnight. But if you see failure as a challenge to modify our approach, you can be inspired by it.
- Holding limiting beliefs is equivalent to systematically ingesting minute doses of arsenic that, over time, builds up a fatal dose
- The most effective way to change our beliefs is to associate massive pain to old beliefs and associate tremendous pleasure to a new, empowering belief.
- Create doubts about beliefs you want to avoid with a new experience, information or counter example to your existing belief. If you question it enough, you'll eventually be able to doubt any belief.
  - Story about how QWERTY keyboard came to be popular despite it being inefficient.
- Three categories of beliefs:
  - Opinions: we feel certain about it, but the certainty is only temporary because it can be changed easily. Opinions can be easily swayed as the legs of reference are weak.
  - Beliefs: based on a much stronger emotions, stronger reference legs. We have an absolute sense of certainty
  - Convictions: An idea with strong emotional intensity such that the idea is not even questioned. Action flows from conviction. People are even willing to rish rejection or make fool of themselves for the sake of it. "Beliefs are possessions, and convictions are simply more values convictions" - Dr. Robert P. Abelson
- How do we create a conviction ?
  - Start with a basic belieft
  - Reinforce your belief by adding new and more powerful references
  - Find trigger event
  - Take action
- **Social proof** - Sometimes convictions are based on other peoples's enthusiasm for your beliefs. People believe something because eveyone else believes it. But social proof isnt always accurate. Dont limit yourself based on other people's beliefts. Question all beliefs!
- Most powerful way to change beliefs is using pain
  - Story of woman who renounces KKK
- Story about how Japan's repuation for quality manufacturing came out to be (Dr. Deming)
  - The idea that quality was a continuous, never ending process
  - Quality costs less
  - Managing business by numbers often hurts the business in the long run
- In order to be happy and improve our quality of life, we need to be constantly growing and improving
  - **kaizen** (japanese) - constant improvement - tiny refinements made daily begin to create compounded enhancements
- CANI - Constant And Never-ending Improvements
  - every minute, continuous improvement over a long term sculpts a masterpiece of colossal proportions

### Can change happen at an instant?
- Willpower itself isnt enough change. We need an effective strategy to create lasting change.
- We cannot change quickly because of our cultural beliefs and conditionining. We link negative associations to change. For most, instant change means there werent problems at all.
  - For eg. in most of the cultures, we are expected to grieve for a certain time after passing of a loved one. We go through with the pain of grieving because if we dont, we assume people will think that we dont care at all. Whereas on some other cultures, death is viewed as a celebration and people celebrate. If you grief, they think you didnt understand life at all, that you are selfish.
  - It all depends upon out belief which indicates how much time it takes to recover from pain.
- If we want to create lasting change, we must take personal responsibility for change. This creates a sense of pain when you dont follow through the new behavior.
- Once we effect a change, we should reinforce it immediately. Then we should condition (link with good emotions) our nervous system to do that behavior consistently.
- "Things dont change; we change" - Henry David Thoreau
- We want change either because we want to change how we feel about things or our behaviors
- First, we must believe that we can change now. If you can create a problem in a moment, you should be able to create a solution too!
  - The psychiatrist joke
- Second, we must believe that we're responsible for our own change. We must believe something **must** change, not should change. We must see ourselves as the source of change. We must believe we **can** change, its possible to change.
- **Most of the time, we try to think our way to change. But change is deep rooted in our behavior and the emotions we associated to it (neuro-associations)**
- When we do something for the first time, we create a physical connection, a neural strand that allows us to re-access that emotion or behavior. Each time we repeat the behavior, the connection strengthens. The more we indulge in a pattern, the stronger it becomes. The converse is also true, the neural connection will weaken and atrophy.
  - Experiment at Uni. of California
- Courage, unused, diminishes. Commitment, unexcercised, wanes. Love, unshared, dissipates.
- Whenever we feel something, the brain notices what around us are **unique** and what happens **simultaneously**. If it happens **consistently**, a neuro-association is made. But since this criteria is imprecise, it easy to fall prey to false neuro-associations. We often blame the wrong causefor the way we feel, and thereby close ourselves from possible solutions.
- Mixed neuro-associations: we have both good and bad feelings about a behavior. When you give your brain mixed messages, we get mixed results(confusion).
  - For eg: sometimes we find ourselves starting to accomplish something, and then destroying it

### How to change anything in your life
- "The beginning of a habit is like an invisible thread but every time we repeat the act we strengthen the strand, add to it another filament, until it becomes a great cable and binds ur irrevocably, thought and act." - Orison Swett Marden
- First we must decide what to change. This will give us more clarity
- Second, we get leverage(motivate) for the change. People dont change until they hit a pain threshold.
  - Even though some people are depressed and unhappy, they dont change becuase the fear of the changing, the unknown is a greater motivating force
  - Nietzsche said that he who has a strong enough why can bear almost any how.
  - 20% of the change is knowing the how; 80% is knowing the why
  - The greatest leverage comes from inside not outside.
  - If we want someone to change, we dont get this leverage by making them wrong or pointing out that they're inconsistent, but rather by asking them questions that cause them to realize for themselves their inconsistencies. This build an internal pressure. Complacency breeds stagnation, the human animal responds to pressure.
  - Create a condition so that not changing is extremely painful.
  - **Ask yourself "What will it cost me, if I dont change?" , "How will it affect my loved ones?"**
  - Ask questions that induce pleasure to the idea of changing
- Third, interrupt the limiting pattern
  - You cannot get a new result if you continue acting the same way
  - Like a fly that smacks itself in the window again and again, in search of a way out
  - Example of man with chocolate addiction
  - One of the best ways to interrupt a pattern is to do unexpected things. Utter 'Hallelujah' next time you feel depressed. Doing a stupid, silly move will not only alter your mood, but also for all of those around you.
  - Interrupt must be done right after a pattern you are trying to avoid.
  - We need to scramble it beyond recognition.
- Fourth, empower the alternative action
  - The benefits of old pattern should be replaced by the benefit of the new pattern.
- Reinforce your new pattern until its consistent.
  - Example of Boston Celtics great Larry Bird shooting a soft-drink commercial
  - If you feel depressed yourself, reward yourself by saying "great" everytime someone else asks you how you are feeling. By doing so, you'll already start to feel good by doing so.
  - Reinforce a pattern right after the behavior.
  - Example of daughter's boyfriend calling everyday.
  - Link pleasure to any behavior you want to repeat.
  - The most effective strategy for motivating employees is through personal development. By helping them grow and expand, they start feeling passionate about their lives, jobs and people. It makes them want to contribute more. Monetary incentives doesnt always work as intended because they begin to work strictly for financial reward.
  - Eventually the reward may no longer be effective, in such cases resort to variable schedule of reinforcements. Example is Dolphin training.

### How to get what you really want
- Many people believe that success makes them happy but whey success finally arrived, they never found the source of their happiness.
  - Example of Elvis Presley's drug abuse
- The difference between acting badly and brilliantly is not based on your ability, but on the state of your mind and/or body in any given moment. We cannot attain excellence if we continually submerge ourselves in negative thoughts.
  - You need to be plugged in the right channel to feel a certain way (just like a tv).
  - There are unlimited sensations, unlimited channels, unlimited ways of looking at things  available at the same time. All we need to do is tune in to the right sensations, channels.
- **Emotion is created by motion**. Every emotion has specific physiology linked to it: posture, breathing, patterns of movement, facial expressions.
  - If we repeatedly use our body in weak ways, if we drop our shoulders in a regular basis, if we walk around being tired, we will feel tired
  - Put a smile in your face and you'll really feel elevated.
- Do unexpected things to make yourself happy, triggering unexpected neural pathways to pleasure. Not only will you entertain yourself, but you'll also entertain other people walking about, you'll change their states to !
- In a poll, 87 people reported they went to movies to feel happy, 7 percent to cry and 3 percent to scream. Everybody loves laughter and its contagious.
- The real key in life is to be able to make yourself feel good when you dont feel good. Know how you can do this immediately by chaning your body patterns.
  - Story of writer's block by John Denver. He needed to experience the thrill of speed feel creative again.
- Create patterns of movement that create confidence, a sense of strength, flexibility, send of personal power and fun.
  - When children see a puddle of water in sidewalk, they are going to jump in, splash around, laught and have a good time. When older people see the same, they will walk around it and complain the whole time !
  - Live with the spring in your step, smile on your face.
- People get depressed by playing out bad memories in their head again and again.
- Our emotions in a particular moment depends upon our focus that that point. If we focus on the bad things, we'll only feel bad.
  - Just like a camera that focuses on a particular thing and can easily distort reality, presenting just a small portion of the big picture.
  - "Each of us sees in others what we carry in our own hearts." -Ralph Waldo Emerson (meaning all of us are biased)
  - turmoil over "unauthorized" biographies - its only one person's perception of another's life, and often, this view is altered by feeling of jealousy or some vested interest.
- **Focus on where you want to go not what you fear**
  - Example of learning race driving in a "skid car" - if you start to skid out of control, the tendency is to look at the wall. But if you keep focusing on it, thats exactly where you'll end up. If you resits your fear and focus on where you want to go, your actions will take you in the direction.
  - Remember - when you change your focus, you dont always immediately change your direction. It might take some "lag time" before you start moving towards your direction. This is all the more reason to start focusing towards our problems quicker.
- A mind out of control will play tricks on you, Directed, its your greates friend.
- "Ask and you will receive. Seek and you will find; knock and it will be opened to you" - Matthew 7:7
- The most powerful way to control focus is with the use of questions. Always ask yourself "why ?"
  - Story of Bo Jackson being bullied on school and how we almost came close to shooting his bully.
- Out of our five senses, each of us have a favorite mode of focus, or a modality. Some are more impacted by visual systems, some by sounds whereas others by feelings.
  - If our favorite channel is visual then focusing on the visual image of a situation gives us more emotional intensity. If its sound, focusing on the kinesthetic channels works best.
  - The specific elements of these five senses can be change so as to increase or decrease the intensity of our experience. These foundational ingredients are called submodalities.
  - By changing the size, distance, color, brightness, intestiy, distance etc in submodalities, we can change how we feel
  - By discovering which submodalities trigger you, you'll know how to increase your positive emotions and decreate negative emotions.
- **The key to life is to find many ways to direct your life so that is becomes an art**. The challenge for many people is they only have handful of ways to change their state: they overeat, overdrink, oversleep, overshop, smoke or take drugs. 
  - Learn to change your focus, order of things to focus on, change your submodalities.
  - If you are going do something, its no use going in a fearful or worried state. Go in a determined state.
- "Experience is not what happend to a man; it is what a man does with what happens to him" - Aldous Huxley
- All our emotions are nothing but biochemical storms in your brains.
- Build a huge list of ways to change your state to feel good. Plan for pleasure on each and every day. Dont just wish for it to show up randomly, make room for it!

### Questions are the answers
- "He who asks questions cannot avoid the answers" - Cameroon Proverb
- When you persistently ask questions expecting answers, youw brain comes up with a solution
  - Example of how a Jewish prisoner escaped the Nazis by asking continuosly asking himself how he can escape from prison
- Its not the events and how you feel, but how you evaluate and interpret the events that shapes your life. Show you interpret and evaluate depends upon what questions you ask.
- Questions are the primary way we learn virtuall anything. In fact the entire Socratic way of teaching is based on teacher doing nothing but asking questions, directing the students' focus, and getting them to come up with their own answers.
- Successful people ask better questions and as a result they get better answers
- Always ask yourself: "Why ?" , "Why not ?"
- We need to understand how to ask the right questions so that we can utilize the tremendous capacity of our brains. Ask terrible questions and you shall receive terrible answers.
- Asking the wrong questions like "Why do i fail ?", "Why me ?" always produces the wrong questions because now your comes up with answers about whay you cannot succeed. Instead ask yourself "How can I use this?"
- Whatever you focus on and ask questions about your brain will find references to back that up. So instead of asking negative questions, ask questions about positive things you want to focus on.
- Its not just the questions you ask but also the questions you fail to ask that shape your destiny.
  - For eg Donal Trump made his fortune in the 70s when everybody was reluctant to take risks by asking himself "How can I get rich while everyone else is afrain ?". But eventually he began to feel invincible and stopped asking "downside" questions like "What is the wrost case scenario and can I handle it ?" that led him into trouble.
- **Superior evaluations create superior life**
- **Learning to ask empowering questions in the moment of crisis is a critical skill**
- **Questions change what we delete** - Our brain can only consciously focus on small number of things simultaneously. If we you're feeling sad, there is only one reason: its because you're deleting all reasons to be feeling good. And if you're feeling good, its because you're deleting all the bad things you could be focusing on.
  - Questions are the laser of human consciousness. They concentrate our focus and determine what we feel and do.
- **Presupposition** - When you ask yourself a question, your brain already assumes it to be true and tries to come up with references in support of it.
- Every faces challenges in life. So the question is not whether you face difficulties or not, but what type of questions you ask in face of such difficulties.
- By consciously asking the right questions, we start creating pathways to happiness, success, excitement, joy etc.
- When in a situation, always ask yourself:
  - Whats great abou this ?
  - How can i use this ?

## The vocabulary of ultimate success
- The right word can be a powerful agent.
  - Eg of how Winston Churchill had this unique ability to send the english word language into battle. His famous call to all Britons to make WWII their "finest hour" resulted in courage beyond compare.
  - Eg of how the racial movement was shaped by words of Martin Luther King Jr.
- We must learn to use our words wisely to make use of the power they command. The words we habitually choose affects how we communicate with ourself and what we experience.
- We can instantly change any emotional experience simply by choosing new words to describe to ourselves what we're feeling.
  - Eg. if we use 'pretty good' to describe a fantastic experience instead of something like 'amazing' we limit the experience we get by it
- English language is filled with words that convey distinct emotional intensity. If we use negative words to describe things, we amplify negative emotinal intensity.
  - Eg. there a difference between saying you 'hate' something vs you 'prefer' something
  - impeccable vs welldone
  - integrity vs honesty
  - pursuit of excellence vs trying to make things better
  - bit challenging vs devastating
  - arguments vs spirited debates
- Putting a new label on your pattern by using a different, more positive word is sometime enough to break your emotional pattern.
- We describe sensation or emotions using words. These are labels for sensations. Sometimes using a word is enough to bring back these sensations.
- If three people are subjected to the same experience, some feels rage, another feels anger and third feels annoyance. The sensations are being changed by each persons translations. Using inappropriate words greater greater pain than is warranted or appropriate.
  - Eg of how commiunism evoked negative emotions even thought most of the participants could describe what communism is.
- Emotions are nothing but biochemical floods in our brain and words indeed create biochemical these effects.
- English language has ~1000 words that describe positive emotions where ~2000 words that create negative emotions (twice as many). No wonder people feel more bad than they feel good.
  - Shakespeare alone use 24000 words in this writings outof which 5000 he used only once. Most of the words we use today were coined by him.
- We are shaped by our language. English language is verb oriented because its a culture which prides itself by taking action. These words how we think and how we evaluate. By contrast, Chinese language places a high value on things that doesnt change as its dialects consists mostly of nouns rather than verbs. From their perspective, nouns represent things that will last, while verbs (as actions) will be here today and gone today.
- By adopting someone else's habitual vocabulary, you can adopt their emotional patterns as well. This way we often become like the people we spend time with as we adopt their emotional pattern
- Adopting a tranformational vocabulary allows us to intensify or diminish any emotional state, positive or negative. This gives us the power to take any negative feelings in our lives and lower its intensity to the point that it no longer bothers us, and take the most positive experiences and move them to even greater heights of pleasure and empowerment.
- Word are basic tool for representign things to ourselves, and often if there's no word, there's no way to think about the experience.
  - Eg. some Native American language have no word for 'lie'. Without a word, the concept doesnt exists, nor is it part of their thinking or behavior.
  - Tasaday tribe in the Philippines reportedly has no words for 'dislike', 'hate' or 'war'
- We can soften emotional intensity by using modifiers
  - "I'm just a bit peeved"
  - "I'm feeling a tad out of sorts"
  - "I'm beginning to get a smidge cranky"
  - "Well thats rather inconvenient"
  - "That shot just underwhelms me" (while playing golf)
- Story of how an organization improved quality of work by calling their workers as craftsmen
- All stage performers get the same kind of tension in stomach before their show. Some call it "stage fright" leading it to frighten them. Bruce Sprintsteen calls it "excitement" as he find it to be an incredibly powerful experience of entertaining people and having them love it. He turned the feeling into an ally.
- Replace words (negative vs less negative words):
  - angry vs disenchanted
  - depressed vs calm before action
  - that stinks vs that's a little aromatic
  - pissed off vs tinkled
  - hate vs prefer
  - irritated vs stimulated
  - overwhelmed vs maximized
  - rejected vs misunderstood
  - terrible vs different
  - break-down vs break-through
- good word vs great word
  - comfortable vs smashing
  - determined vs unstoppable
  - fast vs ballistic
  - fortunate vs unbelievably/blessed
  - great vs phenomenal
  - interested vs enthralled
  - like vs relish
  - okay vs perfect
  - quick vs explosive
  - smart vs gifted
  - terrific vs ecstatic
- Specially useful when taking to childrens
  - Eg instead of saying 'Youre so stupid' or 'Youre so clumsy' you say 'I am a bit peeved about your behavior. Come over here and lets talk about it'
  - This makes it clear that its about their behavior, not anything personal
- Eg of how demagogues Hitler and Saddam Hussein use power of words to their advantage, Persian war, Eisenhower in Korean war, Reagen administration
- But sometimes negative words can be useful in turning angry state into creating enough leverage for a change and action
- We need to be very careful when giving labels to other people as once we put a lable, we create a corresponding emotion.
- Need to be careful when giving labels to patients.
