# Thinking, Fast and Slow - Daniel Kahneman

### Introduction
- System 1: Slow, intuitive thought, entirely automatic from peception and memory (what is the capital of russia ?)
- System 2: Fast, more deliberate and effortful form of thinking (is there a lamp in the desk ?)
- We believe we know what goes in our head but most of the thoughts, impressions arise in our conscious experience without we knowing how they got there
  - We cannot trace how we came to know there is a lamp on the desk in front of us, or how we detected a hint of irritation in our spouse's voice
- Book aims to improve ability to identify and understand error in judgements and choices; suggest invervention to limit the damage
- 'Steve the librarian' demonstration - people ignore base rates when making assumptions
- We might think adultery is more common among politicians than among physicians or lawyers due to the aphrodisiac effect of power and the temptations of life away from home, but its actually because transgressions in politicians are more likely to be reported
- Contrary to historical belief that people are generally rational(with sound thinking) and they depart of rationality due to influence of emotions, their work challenged both views by documenting systematic errors in the thinking of normal people and tracing these errors to cognitive errors rather than emotions. However, recently they have found that emotions has much larger in intuitive judgements and choices in the form of **affect heuristic**
- **Availability Heuristics** - people tend to assess the relative importance of issues by the ease with which they are retrieved from memory, and this is largely determined by the extent of coverage in the media. Frequently mentioned topics populate the mind. In turn what the media choose to report corresponds to their view of what is currently on the public's mind. This is **the main reason why authoritarian regimes exert substantial pressure on independent media**
- Use of demonstrations such as 'Steve the librarian' allows readers to test & observer the possible flaws in their own thinking. This makes them more likely to question their dogmatic assumptions
- Not all intuitive judgement under uncertainty are produced by the heuristics. The accurate intuitions of experts are better explained by the effects of prolonged practice than by heuristics. **Skills and heuristics are alternative sources of intuitive judgements and choices.**
  - Story of a firefighter with "sixth sense of danger"
- Not all professionals' intuition arise from true expertise
  - Story of an investor that invest in Ford stocks after attending its automobile show rather than asking a economically relevant question like "Is Ford stock currently underpriced?" (**affect heuristic**)
- When faced with a difficult question (like should i invest in For stock?), we often answer an easier one instead(do I like Ford cars?) without noticing substitution.
- When search for an intuiting answer fails, we switch to system 2

### The characters of the story
- System 1 operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control
- System 2 allocated attention to the effortful mental activities that demand it, including complex computations. Its operations are often associated with the subjective experience of agency, choice and concentration
- System 1 has learned associations between ideas ( the capital of France ?); it also has learned skills such as reading and understanding nuances of social situations
- System 1:
  - Detect that one object is more distant from another
  - Orient to the source of a sudden sound
  - Detect hostility in a voice
  - Answer to 2+2=?
- System 2:
  - Brace for the starter gun in a race
  - Tell someone your phone number
  - Brace attention for the starter gun in a race
  - Count occurance of letter a in a page of text
- Intense focusing on a task can make people effectively blind, even to stimuli that normally attract attention
  - Experiment to count the number passes by white team, gorilla appears for few second
  - Not only can we be blind to the obvious, we can be blind to our blindness
- Most of what we think and do originates in our system 1, but system 2 takes over when things get difficult and it normally has the last word
- System 1 has biases or systematic errors that it is prone to make in specified circumstances
- System 1 cannot be turned off (we will read a word we are shown, no matter how much we try not to)
- One of the tasks of system 2 is to overcome the impulses of system 1 ie its in charge of self-control
- Some illusions are visual(like the arrow figure in Muller-Lyer illusion) but others are cognitive illusions
  - psychopathic charm - a psychotherapy patient with disturbing tale of multiple mistakes in his previous treatment who you think you can can understand and treat but most likely is a psychopath that you should throw out of the office 
  - You feel sympathetic for this patient but this feeling would not be under our control as it would arise from system 1
  - Strong attraction to a patient with a repeated history of failed treatment is a danger sign
- Constantly questioning our own thinking is tedious and system 2 is much too slow to be used as a substitute for system 1. Learn to recognize situations in which mistakes are likely and try harder to avoid them when staked are high
- Easier to recognize other people's mistakes than our own

### Attention and effort
- Pupil of the eye as a window to the soul (Eckhard Hess, article in Scientific American)
  - Our pupils widen when watching beautiful nature pictures
  - We find women with dilated pupils attractive (rather than constricted ones)
  - Belladona, a pupil dilating susbstance used as cosmetic
  - Bazaar shoppers wear dark glasses in order to hide their level of interest from merchants
- Pupils are sensitive indicators of mental effort - they dilate substantially when people multiply two-digit numbers, and they dilate more if the problems are hard than if they are easy. This indicates that response to mental effort is distinct from emotional arousal
- During mental multiplication, the pupil normally dilated to a large size within a few seconds and stayed large as long as the individual kept working on the problem; it contracted immediately when she found a solution or gave up
- When engaged in mental sprint, we may become effectively blind
- Much like the electricity meter, pupils offer an index of the current rate at which mental energy is used. However, no matter how much effort you want to exert in a task, you cannot exert same effort in an Add-1 task as you would in an Add-3 task
- Response to mental overload - system 2 protects the most important activity so it receives the attention it need, spare capacity is allocated second by second to other tasks
- Attention allocation has been honed by a long evolutionary history. Orienting and responding quickly to the gravest threats or most promising opportunities imporved the chance of survival.
- **As you become skilled in a task, its demand for energy diminishes.**
- **Law of least effort** applied to cognitive tasks as well. If there are several ways of achieving the same goal, people will eventually gravitate to the least demanding course of action. In the economy of action, effort is a cost, and the acquisition of skill is driven by the balance of benefits and costs. **Laziness is built deep into our nature.**
- Research shows that inhibiting the tendency to read distracting words also induces moderate effort
- System 2 is the only one that can follow rules, compare objects on several attributes, and make deliberate choices between options. System 1 detects simple relations ("they are all like")  and excels at integrating information about one thing, but it does not deal with multiple distinct topics at once, nor can it handle purely statistical information
- System 2 can adopt **task sets** : it can program memory to obey an instruction that overrides habitual responses.
  - It will be effortful to set yourself up for an excercise and effortful to carry out, though you will surely improve with practice
- Switching from one task to another is effortful, specially under time pressure.
- Ability to control attention is not simply a measure of intelligence; measure of efficiency in the control of attention predict performance of air traffic controllers and of Israeli Air Force pilots beyond the effect of intelligence.
- **The most effortful forms of slow thinking are those that require you to think fast**
- **We cover long distances by taking our time and conduct our mental lives by the law of least effort**

### The lazy controller
- Some people can expend considerable effort for long periods of time without having to exert willpower.
- This state of effortless attending is known as **flow** (by psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi)
  - "a state of effort-less concentration so deep that they lose their sense of time, of themselves, of their problems" and their description of joy in that state are so compelling that he called it an "optimal experience"
- Several psychological studies has shown that people who are simultaneously challenged by a demanding cognitive task and by a temptation are more likely to yield to the temptation
- People who are cognitively busy are also more likely to make selfish choices, use sexist language, and make superficial judgements in social situations
- The self-control of morning people is impaired at night; the reverse if true of night people.
- Too much concern about how well one is doing in a task sometimes disrupts performance by loading short-term memory with pointless anxious thoughts
- Self-control requires attention and effort. Controlling thoughts and behaviors is one of the tasks of system 2
- All variants of voluntary effort- cognitive, emotional or physical - draw at least partly on a shared pool of mental energy - **ego-depletion** (experiment by Roy Baumeister)
- Unlike cognitive load, ego depletion is at least in part a loss of motivation. Increasing option is not an option when you must keep six digits in short-term memory while performing a task but we could do a task when given strong motivation (even if we dont feel like doing it)
- Experiments show that the effects of ego depletion could be undone by ingesting glucose
  - Parole judge in Israel experiment
- Bat-ball puzzle: The distinctive mark of an easy puzzle it that it evokes an answer that is intuitive, appealing, and wrong.
- Many people are overconfident, prone to place too much faith in their intuition
- Roses-flower problem: When people believe a conclusion is true, they are also very likely to believe arguments that appear to support it, even when these arguments are unsound.
- Memory function is an attribute of system 1
- Children-Oreo experiment - Resisters had higher measures of executive control in cognitive tasks, and especially the ability to reallocate their attention effectively. As young adults, they were less likely to take drugs. Children wo had shown more self-control has substantially hight scors on tests of intelligence
- Experiments showed that improving the control of attention improved intelligence
- Close connection between the children's ability to control their attention and their ability to control their emotions
- Another experiment showed that individuals that are prone to follow their intuitions and unwilling to invest effort needed to check their intuitions were impulsive, impatient, and keen to receive immediate gratification
- **System 1 is impulsive and intuitive; System 2 is capable of reasoning, and is cautious, but at least for some people it is also lazy**
- People with higher IQs are also prone to biases. Rationality should be distinguished from intelligence
- Bat-and-ball like questions are somewhat better indicators of intelligence that conventional measure of intelligence such as IQ tests

### The associative machine
- **Associative activation**: ideas that have been evoked trigger many other ideas, in a spreading cascade of activity in your brain
- Banana-Vomit example: the word evokes memories, which evoke emotions, which in turn evoke facial expressions and other reactions
- System treats the mere conjunction of two words as representation of reality. Your body reacted in an attenuated replica of a reaction to the real thing, and the emotional response and physical recoil were part of the interpretation of the event. **Congnition is embodied: you think with your body, not only with your brain**
- The mechanisam that causes these mental events: **association of ideas**
- An idea that has been activated does not merely evoke one other idea. It activates many ideas, which in turn activate others. Only a few of the activated ideas will register in consciousness; most of the work of associative thinking is silent, hidden from our conscious selves. We know far less about us than we feel.
- **Priming effect**: if you have recently seen or heard the word EAT, you are temporarily more likely to complete the word fragment SO_P as SOUP than as SOAP
  - If you are thinking about EAT, you will be quicker than usual to recognize the word SOUP when it is spoken in a whisper or presented in a blurry font
- Activation spreads like ripples in a pond
- **Priming is not restricted to concepts and words.** The **Florida effect**: the idea of old age results in changes in action. This priming phenomenon - the influencing of an action by the idea - is known as the **ideomotor effect**
- **Priming is reciprocal**. If you are primed to think of old age, you would tend to act old, and acting old would reinforce the thought of old age
- Reciprocal links are common in the associative network. **Being amused tends to make you smile, and smiling tends to make you amused**
- Headphone-head nod experiment: **gestures can also unconsciously influence our thoughts and feelings**. There is a habitual connection between an attitude of rejection or acceptance and its common physical expression
  - Nodding our head(yes gesture) produces emotions related to acceptance while shaking produces emotions for rejection
  - "act calm and kind regardless of how you feel" looks like a good advice as you'll likely be rewarded by actually feeling calmn and kind
- Voting location found to affect our voting decisions. Primed by location.
- Money primed individuals become more independent, perceived twice as long to solve difficult problem when primed with money. Also became more selfish. Money-primed undergraduates also showed a greater preference for being alone
- Living in a culture that surrounds us with reminders of money may shape our behavior and our attitudes in ways that we do not know about and of which we may not be proud
- Reminding people of their mortality increased the appeal of authoritarian ideas, which may become reassuring in context of terror of death
- Feeling that one's soul is stained appears to trigger a desire to cleanse one's body, aka **Lady Macbeth effect**
- The effects of primes are robust but not necessarily large. For eg it can change uncertain people in an election but a few percent could tip an election
- Priming phenomenon arises in system 1 and you have no conscious access to them
- Honesty box experiment - on average, users contributed three times as much in eye weeks as opposed to flower weeks
- System 1 produces impressions that turn into your beliefs, and is the source of the impulses that often become your choices and your actions.

### Cognitive ease
- At any point, multiple computations are going on in our brain. One such computation is determining cognitive ease.
- Cognitive ease means things are going well-no threats, no major news, no need to redirect attention or mobilize effort.
- Cognitive strain means there are problems and require increased mobilization of system 2
- When are in state of cognitive ease, we are probably in good mood, like what we see, believe what we hear, trust our intuitions and feel that the current situation is comfortably similar. We are also relatively casual and superficial in our thinking.
- A happy mood loosens the control of system 2
- When strained, we are vigilant and suspicious, invest more effort in what we are doing, feel less comfortable, make few errors, but also less creative and intuitive
- We are equally susceptible to mental illusions(like optical illusions). Names we have already seen before will be seen more clearly and have a sense of familiarity of them. We will see such names even if they are shown very briefly or masked by noise, and we will be quicker to read them. We experience greater cognitive ease in perceiving a word we have seen earlier. This is called **illusion of familiarity**.
- If no good answer comes to mind, we go by cognitive ease. If the answer feels familiar, we perceive it to be true. If an answer feels new, we assume it to be false. The impression of familiarity is produced by System 1 and System 2 relies on this impression to make a decision.
- **Frequently repeating a false statement is a good way to make it believable as people often misjudge familiarity for the truth.**
  - Authoritarian institutiosn and marketers often use this to their advantage
- If we use simpler words to convey a message, it appears to be more credible and intelligent. Using simple words reduces congnitive load and maximizes legibility.
  - We can make a message more memorable and truthy by using verses
- Avoid using complicated company names and it invokes system 2 and people want to avoid deliberate effort in remembering a difficult name
- Cognitive strain mobilizes system 2, which is more likely to reject the intuitively suggested by system 1
  - Students made less errors in puzzles printed in a small font in a washed-out gray print
- Companies with pronounceable names do better than others for the first week after the stock is issued, though the effect disappeares over time
- Congnitive ease is both a cause and a consequence of pleasant feeling
- **Exposure effect** - familiarity breeds liking

### Norms, surprises, and causes
- System 1 maintains a model our personal world, with association of ideas and whats normal in it. 
- We are surprised when we encounter something that doesnt fit into the context or in our model of things. System 1 can detect these with astonishing speed and subtlety.
- Understanding events, consequences and causal connections in a story is function of system 1.
- We are adept at finding both physical and intentional causality(bullies and victims, pursuer and something being chased)

### A machine for jumping to conclusions
- System 1 is responsible for jumping to conclusions. It bets on an answer based on your recent experience and context. In absense on recent experience, more distant memories govern our choices.
  - 'Bank' can mean a river bank or a money bank based on context.
  - We can read 'ABC' and '12 13 14' and also 'A13C' and '12 B 14' thanks to system 1. It jumps to conclusions and resolves ambiguity even thought we dont become aware of the ambiguity that was resolved
- System 1 comes with one interpretation when jumping to conclusions. Neither does it keeps track to what alternatives it rejects, nor does it compares them. Comparison between incompatible interpretations require deliberate effort(system 2)
- System 1 is gullible and biased to believe. When confronted with an statement, its automatic response is to believe it by coming up with automatic interpretation of the situation. Unbelieving is the work of system 1. **People are more likely to believe persuasive messages and commercials when they are tired and depleted.**
- This operation of associative memory leads to confirmation bias. When confronted with a statement, our initial response it to search for confirming evidence(positive test strategy), instead of coming up with facts that refute it (negative test strategy)
- **Halo effect** - The tendency to like(or dislike) everything about a person including things you havent observed. If you have a feeling of liking a person, you are predisposed to thinking that he/she is also generous or intelligent. If you like the policy of a politician, you also like his voice or appearance. When you like a person, the gap is filled by a guess that fits your emotional response to that person.
  - The sequence to information matters, sometimes to the point that subsequent information has no effect at all.
  - Halo effect is also an example of supressed ambiguity, just like the word 'bank', the word 'stubborn' is translated with regards to your emotions for that person
  - Example of Kahneman checking student essays
  - Tame Halo effect by **decorrelating errors**. When deriving information from multiple sources, get information from they individually so that they arent influenced by a each other's biases. 'The Wisdom of Crowds' (book)
  - Decorrelating errors is highly useful while conducting meeting.
- **What You See Is All There Is (WYSIATI)** - System 1 excels at constructing a story with the information currently available.
- Jumping to conclusions based on limited information is vital part of System 1. It is radically insensitive to the quality and quantity of the information. When confronted with incomplete information, all it cares about is the ease and coherence with which it forms a story. The incompleteness of the information doesnt matter.
  - People with partial (and incomplete) information are more confident of their judgements, leading to **confidence bias**.
  - **Framing effect** - Different ways of presenting the same information often evokes different emotions
    - "the odds of survival after one month of surgery is 90%" vs "mortality within one month of surgery is 10%"
    - "90% fat-free" vs "10% fat"
  - **Base-rate neglect** - Steve, the meek and tidy soul
