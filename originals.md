# Originals - Adam Grant

### Out on a limb
- "The way to come to power is not always to merely challenge the Establishment, but first make a place in it and then challenge and double-cross the Establishment" - Francis Ford Coppola
- When we gain respect of our peers, we gain idiosyncrasy credits - the latitude to deviate from the group's expectations. Our original ideas are more likely to be applauded.
- To earn this status, we have to alter the way we speak. One interesting and effective strategy is to present weaknesses in our original ideas. Doing so will:
  - Disarm your audience - When people find that we are not trying to persuade, they lower their mental shields. It shifts focus away from self defense to problem solving.
  - It makes us look smarter because people think that any amateur can appreciate the positive sides of something, but it takes an expert/professional to critique it.
  - Makes us appear more trustworthy because we seem not only knowledgeable, but modest and honest.
  - Makes the audience harder to come up with negative ideas because we've already acknowledged the serious ones ourselves.
- We stand more chance of our original ideas being accepted if we speak up more about them, then rinse and repeat. It makes them familiar which makes people comfortable with them. Familiar ideas are easier process. Exposure effect
- Albert Hirschman - four different options for handling a dissatisfying situation: exit, voice, persistence and neglect
- Difficult/prickly people are more likely to take a stand against others and against convention. They might have a bad user interface but a great operating system.
- Disagreeable manager are more inclined to challenge us, improving our ability to speak up effectively. They tend to more open to new ideas and challenging the status quo. On the other hand, mid level manager are more likely to maintain the status quo. Known as middle-status conformity effect.
- Disagreeable managers are more likely to be positive towards original ideas.
- Speaking out in favor of original ideas is specially hard for minority groups members and women. Its better to reach a status of power to voice your ideas.
- Women largely avoid this backlash when they speak out on behalf of others instead of their own. More likely to suffer sexual harassment when they deviate from stereotype of being communal, feminine.
- The best strategy is to voice our opinions and secure our risk portfolios, preparing for exit if necessary.
- In the long run, people often regret not voicing their opinions more.
